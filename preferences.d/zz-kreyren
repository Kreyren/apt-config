# P >= 1000 -- causes a version to be installed even if this constitutes a downgrade of the package
# 990 <= P < 1000 -- causes a version to be installed even if it does not come from the target release, unless the installed version is more recent
# 500 <= P < 990 -- causes a version to be installed unless there is a version available belonging to the target release or the installed version is more recent
# 100 <= P < 500 -- causes a version to be installed unless there is a version available belonging to some other distribution or the installed version is more recent
# 0 < P < 100 -- causes a version to be installed only if there is no installed version of the package
# P < 0 -- prevents the version from being installed

# Abstract
# - Install everything from debian unless there is a package for devuan
# - Do not install non-free unless pinned explicitely
